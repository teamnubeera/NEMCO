        <h1>EC2 Key Concepts and Terminologies</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Instances</h2>
        <p>An Amazon EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the AWS infrastructure. EC2 instances can be launched with various configurations for CPU, memory, storage, and networking.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Types of Instances: Standard, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized, etc.</li>
            <li>Instance States: Pending, Running, Stopped, Terminated</li>
            <li>Launch Configurations: Choose OS, instance type, storage, and networking options.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)</h2>
        <p>An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured template for launching EC2 instances. AMIs include the operating system, application server, applications, and related configurations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AMI Types: Public AMIs, Custom AMIs, and Marketplace AMIs.</li>
            <li>Region-Specific: AMIs are available in specific regions.</li>
            <li>Creating Custom AMIs: Save the configuration of an existing instance to launch more instances with the same configuration.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Elastic Block Store (EBS)</h2>
        <p>Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are used for storing data that requires frequent updates and low-latency access.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Persistent Storage: EBS volumes persist beyond instance termination.</li>
            <li>Volume Types: SSD-backed, HDD-backed, and other specialized types (e.g., io1, gp2, st1).</li>
            <li>Snapshots: EBS snapshots allow you to back up and restore data.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Elastic IP Addresses</h2>
        <p>Elastic IP Addresses (EIP) are static IPv4 addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. An EIP is associated with your AWS account and can be associated with EC2 instances as needed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Static IP: Unlike regular dynamic IP addresses, EIPs do not change when you stop and start your instance.</li>
            <li>Association: You can associate an EIP to any EC2 instance within your account.</li>
            <li>Reallocation: EIPs can be reassigned to other EC2 instances.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Security Groups</h2>
        <p>A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. It defines which traffic is allowed to and from your instance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stateful: Inbound and outbound rules are evaluated separately.</li>
            <li>Allow Rules: Security groups only allow traffic based on defined rules (no deny rules).</li>
            <li>Multiple Security Groups: EC2 instances can be associated with multiple security groups for flexible access control.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
